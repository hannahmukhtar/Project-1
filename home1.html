                <p>Hi, my name is Hannah Mukhtar and I’m a current undergraduate student at UC Berkeley Haas studying Business with potential certificates in Design Innovation and Entrepreneurship & Technology. I'm exploring the fields of Product Management and Entrepreneurship Law currently. My journey has been a blend of creativity and technology, constantly driven by the desire to push boundaries and make meaningful connections.</p>

                <p>From authoring *Meadow of Whispers*, a novel that pushes the boundaries of poetry, to founding Nutra, an app dedicated to simplifying nutrition for everyday life, I bring a unique perspective that merges art with innovation. I believe in the power of stories to inspire change, and my work reflects a commitment to creating with purpose. Let’s explore new ideas and share experiences. Thank you for visiting my little corner of the internet!</p>
